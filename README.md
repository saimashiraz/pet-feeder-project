Automated Pet Feeder System

Project Overview
This project is a simulation of a low-cost, programmable automated pet feeder designed for a local animal shelter. The system is intended to:
- Dispense food for pets at scheduled times
- Monitor whether the food has been consumed
- Alert staff if food is not dispensed or not eaten
- Log feeding events for tracking and analysis

The solution was developed using the Solving Problem Process taught in the Introduction to Information Technology course at the University of Canberra.

Problem Statement
There is currently no system that both dispenses food for pets at scheduled times and monitors consumption. Staff must manually feed animals and cannot track whether meals were eaten or how much was consumed. This project proposes a programmable feeder that automates feeding, monitors consumption, and alerts staff when issues arise.


Assumptions
- Only one pet feeds at a time
- Feeding occurs only at scheduled times
- Stable internet connection is available
- Portion sizes are pre-configured
- Alerts are sent via internet to staff

Inputs and Outputs

Inputs
- Feeding times
- Real-time clock
- Food level sensor
- Bowl weight sensor
- Pet type

Outputs
- Servo motor activation
- Feeding status display
- Alert notifications
- Feeding event log

Logic Summary
The system checks the current time against scheduled feeding times. If itâ€™s time to feed and food level is sufficient, it activates the servo motor to dispense food. It then monitors the bowl weight before and after feeding to determine if the pet has eaten. Alerts are sent if food is not dispensed or not eaten.


Testing
Five test scenarios were run:
1. Pet eats as expected 
2. Pet does not eat 
3. Dispenser is empty 
4. Food not dispensed
5. Feeding time not yet reached 

All tests passed, with suggestions for retry logic and early alerts added.

AI Integration
Microsoft Copilot was used to:
- Validate inputs, outputs, and variables
- Refine pseudocode and flowchart logic
- Suggest retrying mechanisms and alert improvements
- Enhance documentation and structure

Reflection included in `/AI Integration`.

Submission Notes
- All files are organized by step
- Flowchart created using Draw.io and exported as PNG
- GitHub repository shared with tutor and lecturer
- Final ZIP file includes all required documents
